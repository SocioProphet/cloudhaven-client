This is very new project and thus this is a very preliminary "CONTRIBUTING" file.

The initial goal for CloudHaven is to create a prototype that generates the fundamentals of CloudHaven, principally the User Interface-as-a-Service but also including the following:

1. User-Interface-as-a-Service (UIaaS)
2. Personal Data tokenization
3. File Sharing/File Viewer embedding
4. Collaboration Component embedding
5. Application registration
6. Basic User Management
7. User Authentication
8. One-click user registration

Comp Sci students of any form of institutions (colleges, universities, 42, etc.) are encouraged to participate.
Diversity is also strongly encouraged.

While CloudHaven is open source and free to use, copy, commercialize, etc. under the MIT license, the most optimal use of the cloudhave software will be by a single multi-stakeholder cooperative that is vendor neutral, has a maximized network affect and advocates for its users.

Ideal contributors will also have a passion for equitable ownership and democratic workplaces, especially worker cooperatives including multi-stakeholder cooperatives.
Ideal contributors will have a passion for a knowledge of platform cooperatives (see http://platform.coop)
Ideal contributors will also be passionate about sustainability, diversity, social justice, etc.

More information on CloudHaven can be found at http://www.cloudhaven.net

CloudHaven is currently forming the founding team which will draft main project goals for the initial prototype, a corresponding project plan and assignment of responsibilities.
